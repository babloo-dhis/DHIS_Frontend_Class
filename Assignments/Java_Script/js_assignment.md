# JavaScript Assignment: Control Statements

This assignment focuses on writing JavaScript programs using control statements. For each type of control statement, you will solve three different problems, each with a unique scenario. Read each question carefully and write your solutions in separate code blocks.

## 1. **If-Else Statements**

Write three programs using `if-else` statements:

1. **Grade Calculator:**  
    Given a student's score (0-100), print the grade (A, B, C, D, F) based on the following criteria:  
    - A: 90-100  
    - B: 80-89  
    - C: 70-79  
    - D: 60-69  
    - F: below 60

2. **Even or Odd:**  
    Take a number as input and print whether it is even or odd.

3. **Eligibility Check:**  
    Given a person's age, check if they are eligible to vote (age >= 18). Print "Eligible" or "Not Eligible".

## 2. **Switch Statements**

Write three programs using `switch` statements:

1. **Day of the Week:**  
    Given a number (1-7), print the corresponding day of the week (e.g., 1 = Monday, 2 = Tuesday, ...).

2. **Calculator:**  
    Take two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /) as input. Use a switch statement to perform the operation and print the result.

3. **Traffic Light:**  
    Given a color ("red", "yellow", "green"), print the action a driver should take ("Stop", "Ready", "Go").

## 3. **For Loops**

Write three programs using `for` loops:

1. **Multiplication Table:**  
    Print the multiplication table for a given number up to 10.

2. **Sum of Numbers:**  
    Calculate and print the sum of all numbers from 1 to N (N is user input).

3. **Print Even Numbers:**  
    Print all even numbers between 1 and 50.

---

## 4. **While Loops**

Write three programs using `while` loops:

1. **Countdown:**  
    Print numbers from N down to 1 (N is user input).

2. **Sum Until Zero:**  
    Keep taking numbers as input and add them to a sum until the user enters 0. Print the final sum.

3. **Password Checker:**  
    Keep asking the user to enter a password until they enter the correct one ("letmein").

## 5. **Nested Control Statements**

Write three programs using nested control statements:

1. **Prime Numbers in a Range:**  
    Print all prime numbers between 1 and N (N is user input).

2. **Pattern Printing:**  
    Print a right-angled triangle pattern of stars for a given number of rows.

3. **Student Pass/Fail:**  
    For a list of students and their marks, print whether each student has passed (marks >= 40) or failed.

**Instructions:**  
- For each question, write a separate JavaScript program (do not use functions).
- Add comments to explain your logic.
- Test your code with different inputs to cover multiple scenarios.
- Submit your solutions in this markdown file.
