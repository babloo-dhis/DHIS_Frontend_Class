    Use a `for` loop to print numbers from 1 to 10 in the console.

2. **Print Even Numbers 2 to 20:**  
    Use a `for` loop to print all even numbers between 2 and 20.

3. **Print Multiples of 5 up to 50:**  
    Use a `for` loop to print all multiples of 5 from 5 to 50.

4. **Countdown from 10 to 1:**  
    Use a `for` loop to print numbers from 10 down to 1.

5. **Sum of Numbers 1 to 100:**  
    Use a `for` loop to calculate and print the sum of numbers from 1 to 100.

### While Loop Assignments

1. **Print Numbers 1 to 10:**  
    Use a `while` loop to print numbers from 1 to 10.

2. **Print Odd Numbers 1 to 19:**  
    Use a `while` loop to print all odd numbers between 1 and 19.

> **Note:** Do not use arrays or nested loops. Each assignment should use only one loop and simple variables.
