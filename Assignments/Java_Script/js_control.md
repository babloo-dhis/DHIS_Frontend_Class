# JavaScript Control Structures: Practice Assignments

## Instructions
Complete the following exercises to strengthen your understanding of JavaScript control structures. Each problem focuses on a specific concept such as `if`, `if...else`, `if...else if...else`, nested `if`, `switch`, and the ternary operator.

---

### 1. If Statement
**a.** Write a program to check if a number is greater than 100.  
**b.** Display "Eligible for discount" if a purchase amount is above 500.

---

### 2. If...Else Statement
**a.** Write a program to check if a person is eligible for driving (age ≥ 18).  
**b.** Print "Positive" if a number is greater than zero, otherwise print "Not Positive".

---

### 3. If...Else If...Else Statement
**a.** Print "Positive", "Negative", or "Zero" for a given number.  
**b.** Check the grade of a student:
- If marks ≥ 90: "A"
- Else if marks ≥ 75: "B"
- Else if marks ≥ 50: "C"
- Else: "Fail"

---

### 4. Nested If Statement
**a.** Write a program to check:
- If age ≥ 18 → print "Adult"
- Else if age ≥ 13 → print "Teenager"
- Else → print "Child"

**b.** Check if a number is even, and if so, also check if it is greater than 50.

---

### 5. Switch Statement
**a.** Print the name of a month for numbers 1-12 using a switch statement.  
**b.** Write a program to print the day of the week for numbers 1-7.

---

### 6. Ternary Operator
**a.** Use a ternary operator to check if a number is even or odd.  
**b.** Use a ternary operator to print "Pass" if marks ≥ 40, otherwise "Fail".

---

### 7. Challenge Assignments
**a.** Write a program that takes a user's age and prints a message:
- If age < 0: "Invalid age"
- If age < 13: "Child"
- If age < 18: "Teenager"
- If age ≥ 18: "Adult"

**b.** Use a switch statement to print the season ("Spring", "Summer", "Autumn", "Winter") based on month number.

**Tip:** Try to solve each problem using the specified control structure.
