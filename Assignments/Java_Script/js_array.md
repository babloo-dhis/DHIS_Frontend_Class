# JavaScript Array Assignment

Practice the following array methods and concepts. Write code examples and explanations for each. Try to solve each task step by step.

---

## 1. Array Basics
- Create an array of 5 numbers.
- Print the array and its length.

## 2. Adding and Removing Elements
- Use `push()` to add an element to the end.
- Use `pop()` to remove the last element.
- Use `unshift()` to add an element to the beginning.
- Use `shift()` to remove the first element.

## 3. Accessing Elements
- Find the index of a specific value using `indexOf()`.
- Check if an element exists using `includes()`.

## 4. Slicing and Splicing
- Use `slice()` to copy part of the array.
- Use `splice()` to remove or add elements in the middle.

## 5. Concatenation
- Combine two arrays using `concat()`.

## 6. Joining Elements
- Use `join()` to create a string from array elements.

## 7. Looping Through Arrays
- Use a `for` loop to print each element.
- Use `forEach()` to print each element.

## 8. Array Methods
- Use `map()` to create a new array with each value doubled.
- Use `filter()` to create a new array with only even numbers.
- Use `reduce()` to find the sum of all numbers.

## 9. Sorting
- Sort the array in ascending order.
- Sort the array in descending order.

### Instructions
- Write code for each topic.
- Add comments explaining what each line does.
- Try to use different types of values (numbers, strings) for practice.

**Bonus:**  
- Create a function that takes an array and returns a new array with only unique values.
