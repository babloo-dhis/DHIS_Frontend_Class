## 10. Function Scope
1. What is function scope in JavaScript?

Variable declared inside a function cannot be used outside of the function.

2. Write a function that declares a variable inside and try to access it outside.

function testmarks() {
    let subject = "Maths";
}
 
console.log(subject);

3. How does scope affect variable accessibility?
4. Explain the difference between global and local scope.
5. Use nested functions to demonstrate scope chaining.
6. What happens if two functions declare variables with the same name?
